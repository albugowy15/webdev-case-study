# Talent Growth : Web Development Case Study

For this submission, I build a homepage using Next.JS and Tailwind CSS. I create 6 base components, that is Navbar, Biodata, Skills, Education, Contact, and Footer. For styling, Tailwind CSS helps me a lot. I can easily make componenenst to be responsive and adapt in every viewport. I also give them a simple animation just to make it more live and interactive.
