# Talent Growth : Web Development Case Study

[Demo Homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49820990/178495326-dc4bc14e-7909-4e23-974e-abad826785d3.webm)

For this submission, I build a homepage using Next.JS and Tailwind CSS. I create 6 base components, that is Navbar, Biodata, Skills, Education, Contact, and Footer. For styling, Tailwind CSS helps me a lot. I can easily make componenenst to be responsive and adapt in every viewport. I also give them a simple animation just to make it more live and interactive.
